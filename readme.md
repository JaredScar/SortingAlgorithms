# SortingAlgorithms
SortingAlgorithms is a project made for people who want to understand the sorting algorithms more clearly. The project was made in hopes to simplify what is happening throughout the sorting process to the user in attempts of better understanding the algorithm in the end goal. SortingAlgorithms also includes the 2 search algorithms, Sequential Search and Binary Search for even more explanation as it dives into a little bit of search algorithms as well.
